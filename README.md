## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites:-
Python 3.8 or higher
pip package manager

### Installation
- Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/dhruvg24/Machine_Learning_Project.git
cd Machine_Learning_Project
- Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
- Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🧪Usage
### 🔁Training the model
python src/train.py
This script will process the data, train the model, and save the trained model artifacts in the artifacts/ directory.

### 🌐Running the Application
To start the Flask web application:
python app.py
Access the application by navigating to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

📊 Results
After training, the model achieved the following performance metrics:

Accuracy: --%

Precision: --%

Recall: --%

F1-Score: --%
